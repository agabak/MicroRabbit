This is what i did then,

Add a new/fresh user, say user test and password test:

rabbitmqctl add_user test test
Give administrative access to the new user:

rabbitmqctl set_user_tags test administrator
Set permission to newly created user:

rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / test ".*" ".*" ".*"
That's it, enjoy :)
